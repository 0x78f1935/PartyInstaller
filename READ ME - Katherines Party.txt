WHAT IS KATHERINE'S PARTY?

Katherine's Party is a custom story, set up as a sort of alternate reality sequel to the original story. For some reason, the girls are *much* easier at Katherine's Party. There might also be something else going on...

Because this story is envisioned as a sequel, and because I reused/repurposed a lot of things from the original story, I strongly reccomend played through all of the original story's content before playing this. There are likely to be spoilers otherwise.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

Extract the zip to your "<Documents>\Eek\House Party\Mods\Stories" folder. You should end up with a folder called "Katherines Party." Start the game and choose "Katherines Party" from the list of stories.

KNOWN ISSUES

If you start relations with a girl in certain places (on the bottom of the stairs, near the front door, maybe in the laundry room), you can be teleported into locked rooms (garage or art studio). This can be a minor spoiler for the story. Worse, if you don't already have the right keys, you and your partner will be locked in there. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out a good way around this problem. Try to avoid starting sex on the stairs, in the front hall, or very close to the art studio door. 

If you do get stuck, you can give yourself the right key using the console. Hit the ~ key on your keyboard and type:

- player inventory add key2 (for the garage key)
- player inventory add key (for the art room key)

The rest of this read me file has hints and spoilers...
